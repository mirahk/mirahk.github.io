Welcome to my website!

I am currently a part-time MS in Biostatisitics student at Columbia University and full-time clinical scientist at Merck. I graduated from Bucknell University in 2021 with a BS is Chemical Engineering. Outside of work and school, I enjoy art museums and galleries, spending time with my friends and family, and cooking:)
